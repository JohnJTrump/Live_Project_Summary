# Live_Project_Summary
 
Over a two-week period during a Python Bootcamp I attended with The Tech Academy, I served as an Intern for Proper Consulting Incorporated. During that time I worked with a large team to develop a multi app project which ultimately will scrape data with the use of API’s for multiple different topics. The team utilized Django and Python as the language and platform to consolidate and present the apps which were being developed. 

My assignment dealt with gathering information about movie theaters and what types of creature comforts were offered at each location. 


I began the project by attaching an app icon fitting of the content:

When a user hovers over the image above, the text: “Theaters and Features” appears in the gray translucent box.



Once the user clicks on the image it brings them to the home screen pictured below. While on the home screen they are giving multiple options; Go back to the Parent App’s home screen “App Builder 9000 Directory”, Add a new theater to the database “Add a Theater” and finally view saved theaters in the database “Find a Theater”.

When a User selects “Add a Theater”, they are linked to a data entry page, seen below. This page allows the user to add key features about a theater which then saves the users entries in a database.

A user also has the ability to view the Theaters which have been saved in the database by clicking on the “Find a Theater” link. By clicking this link, it brings up a table of saved theaters, pictured below, which are also links to a separate page to view each theaters individual details.

When a theater is selected from the table shown above, it links the user to a page specific to that theater displaying all data associated with it, pictured below. This screen also gives the user the ability to edit the entry, or completely delete it from the database.

If a user clicks the edit link it brings them to the data entry page specific to the theater they are attempting to edit the information of, shown below for a selected theater.

If a user selected the delete function while on the selected theater page it displays a confirmation page, shown below, asking the user if they are sure they would like to delete the theater from the database.

Below are a couple snippets of code which were used to create this app.

Above you can see the Django model which connects to a SQlite created database. With this model I chose to have 4 drop down menus for ease of data entry, collection and retrieving.

Above is a snippet of a few functions created inside Django which were used in the app. 

 

I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project with the team, hitting roadblocks, talking our way through them and coming up with elegant solutions to move past the bug and onto another aspect of the program.  

The next part of this program will be to add an API and use it to add content to the app. 

 

Thanks for checking out this project, I look forward to working with you on something amazing in the near future.
